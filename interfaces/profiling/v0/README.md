# `profiling`

## Usage

This interface can be used by an application able to ingest profiling data to expose the ingestion 
endpoint(s) to any application able to push into them.

## Direction

This interface implements a provider/requirer pattern. As is customary, the provider is the server 
(the profiling data ingester) and the requirer is the profiling data source.

The interface is unidirectional: the provider doesn't need any information from the requirer.
The provider shares any and all supported ingestion endpoints.

## Behavior
### Provider

- Must publish all active ingestion endpoints.
- Must accept data on those endpoints
- If ingress is available, the provider must advertise its ingressed hostname, 
  otherwise fall back to using its own cluster-internal fqdn.
- Must pass `insecure=True` if the ingestion endpoints are running with insecure connection.

## Relation Data

[\[Pydantic Schema\]](./schema.py)

#### Example
A yaml/json example of a valid databag state (for the whole relation), in absence of an ingress 
integration for the provider:
```yaml
provider:
  app: {
         otlp_grpc_endpoint_url: "my.fqdn.cluster.local:1234",
         insecure: False,
  }
  unit: {}
requirer:
  app: {}
  unit: {}
```

If the provider is ingressed:
```yaml
provider:
  app: {
         # `10.0.0.1` is the ingress hostname of the provider charm
         otlp_grpc_endpoint_url: "10.0.0.1:1234",
         insecure: False,
  }
  unit: {}
requirer:
  app: {}
  unit: {}
```
