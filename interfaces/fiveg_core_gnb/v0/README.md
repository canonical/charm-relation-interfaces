# `fiveg_core_gnb`

## Usage

Within 5G, the CU is the Central Unit of a RAN (Radio Access Network) and needs to be configured according to the 5G network parameters.

The `fiveg_core_gnb` relation interface describes the expected behavior of any charm claiming to be able to provide or consume the CU (or gNodeB) configuration information.

In a typical 5G network, the provider of this interface would be a CU or a gNodeB. The requirer of this interface would be the NMS (Network Management System).

## Direction

```mermaid

    Provider -- MCC, MNC, TAC, SST, SD --> Requirer
    Requirer -- CU/gNodeB Identifier --> Provider
```

As with all Juju relations, the `fiveg_core_gnb` interface consists of two parties: a Provider and a Requirer.

## Behavior

Both the Requirer and the Provider need to adhere to criteria to be considered compatible with the interface.

### Provider

- Is expected to provide the following data:
  - TAC (Tracking Area Code)
  - List of PLMNs

The list of PLMNs should include the following data:
  - MCC (Mobile Country Code)
  - MNC (Mobile Network Code)
  - SST (Slice Service Type)
  - SD (Slice Differentiator)
    

### Requirer

- Is expected to provide a unique identifier of the CU (or gNodeB).
