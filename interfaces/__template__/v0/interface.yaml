# `name` of the interface, as it should be referenced by charms.
# This should be the same as the name of the interface specification directory.
# When proposing a new interface, opt for underscores over dashes.
# The name corresponds to the line with the arrow in the charm metadata snippet below:
#
# ```yaml
# provides:
#   self-metrics-endpoint:
#     interface: prometheus_scrape <--
# ```
#
name: __template__

# Uncomment the line below if the interface is to be considered internal, meaning that it
# is not designed to be used by others, nor should it appear on charmhub:
#
# internal: true

# `version` starts at `0` and increments with every breaking change in the interface specification.
version: 0

# `status` describes where the interface is in its lifecycle. Valid values are described in LEGEND.md.
status: draft

# `providers` lists charms that implement the providing side of the interface.
# To be included in this list, charms must pass all tests defined in the `interface_tests` directory.
providers:
  - name: charm-using-the-provider-side
    url: https://github.com/foo/charm-using-the-provider-side-k8s-operator  # repo to clone for the tests; required

# `requirers` list charms that implement the requiring side of the interface.
# this follows the same structure as `providers`. 
requirers: []
